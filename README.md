a world UI to update and fix capitalism

Primary element is an interface in which we can aggregate what we really want and then reverse-engineer that, and align our training and work plus necessary resources to make what we have determined we really want. End world hunger. Get paid and work only as much as really needed. Live our best possible lives.

Sunlight bathes the Earth in so much energy that what falls on only a small percentage of the Earth's surface could power every manner of energy consumed today. However, the sun's energy is very diffuse and to successfully harvest enough energy to be usably scalable takes aligning it to be focused. (We haven't done nearly enough of this, but there are proof-of-concept collection facilities.)

In the same way, we as world inhabitants, have an incredible amount of power but it is very diffuse. What we buy essentially is a direction of what the economy did right - a rearview rudder.

Corporations and businesses (corbs) have been the socioeconomic entities that have done the focusing of our choices - they take a look at what we have bought up to now, how much money we have, and what we are likely to buy and make (or not make) goods and services going forward to match their guesses. Their survival depends on their guessing right.

The problem with this mnodel is that corbs have profit as their goal, which would be fine if they were small such that no one entity could dominate its market. But the endgame of capitalism is monopoly, not utoipa, and with monopoly come some very unpleasant behaviors - the ability to price gouge, buying out and shelving competition, infiltrating and controling the laws where the corbs operate, SLAPPs, etc. So we need a way to align ourselves so good things happen for people rather than predatory profits for monolithic corbs.

To that end I am calling on you to consider helping to start an open source project in which (and this list is surely missing other needed elements)
1) people *dynamically* register how they would spend a $150,000 salary
2) creative/idea folks would input new ideas and improvements that would be incorporated into what people could choose
3) systems architects would participate and design the infrastructure to make what people say they want
4) in style of GoFundMe purchase the resources to build the infrastructure
5) trainers would upload training courses to work the jobs entailed to build and run the infrastructure
6) manager types would coach, include, inspire and help align folks as they choose how and where to participate
7) there is a reward feedback protocol for folks who participate more in helping to achieve what is wanted

A major endpoint of this system is to get the economic and civilization horse in front of the cart (true demand), rather than the supply-side push way of doing business currently, where 
• corbs best-guess at what to provide that we may or may not want (based on what money we have rather than what capacity the economy as a whole is capable of), • that eventually tends towards yielding huge profits for a few owners rather than what is best for people, that tends towards misusing world resources, 
• that provides jobs that squander folks' time and talent and are convenient for the corbs, but may change on such a large scale that people are not able to realign as fast as the work and without money in their pockets, their needs/wants/desires suddenly have no driving power to direct what the economy should do or make.

The intent is not to just outright give people $150,000/year, but to use people's concept of what money is today - what it buys, what people get paid, etc., as a value metric to put the bar not just higher, but more accurately determine people's true preferences, both of what they want and what work they can and will do, so as to know where and how to expand all we do and make. And when there is not enough of a specific thing people indicate they'd like if they had more money, we don't jack the price, we increase economies of scale to not only make more but make it more effectively and bring the price down so that people end up achieving above $150,000 of value (or they work shorter hours and still achieve a level of life far above where they are now).

Regarding "how they would spend a $150,000 salary" - this will take some work and getting used to. But in addition to aiming for economies of scale, we want to also incorporate customization granularity as much as possible so what any one person is able to input as a want lets the person customize as much as possible. As an example think of buying jeans. Let's not just ramp up how many jeans of generic sizes to make, but establish a fitting system (BAM local fitting rooms with laser topography?) to allow everyone to put in for jeans that will fit perfectly, no matter how their bodies are (tall, thin, etc.). Incorporate customization as much as possible in how we ramp up scale. End result: we make all the jeans we collectively want, without frustrating out of stock or overstock that has to be discarded.

Consider this: There is enough food grown that everyone in the world could be fed. It's just there are so many who are poor and can't buy the available food. And they are poor because they don't have a way to participate effectively in the economy. If they were able to know and do jobs that fulfill what we all say we want, they could do far better than just no longer starve.

There'd need to be a slightly different funding and reward system for R&D. Currently either R&D is done either at universities and the students and professors with successful ideas jump out to start companies to milk the value of their work, or by corbs that then charge prices far higher than cost plus a bit extra for profit. Excellent ideas and hard work of R&D absolutely deserve significant rewards, but reaping many extra millions or billions because an idea is so wanted, bulldozes the fact that their idea or service would be worthless
• without 7 billion people in the world to whom they can sell their good or service, 
• without human legacy providing a knowledge base for any new idea to start from, 
• if our Earth is destroyed by the very concept of "value of resources" indicating that they think of the Earth as a lemon to be squeezed until dry rather than a billions-of-years old system that is more precarious and interconnected than we appreciate.
